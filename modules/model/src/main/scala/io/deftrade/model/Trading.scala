  * What does "double entry bookkeeping" mean in the context of a shared distributed ledger with

  *
  * It means this:
  * - we keep contra accounts per OMS gateway
  * - we debit that account when we "buy shares" (creates negative balance)
  * - we credit that account when settlement happens (zeros out the balance)
  * - we "reverse polarity" when we enter a short position.
  * - we can indexAndSum settled positions for reconcilliation
  *
  * TODO - provisional:
  * we depend on `Balances` because it makes no sense
  * to trade blind with respect to account sums - these calcs are intrinsic to margin (I think)
